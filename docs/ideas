use 
try for CANTRIPS because they are level 0 spells


This is just a rough idea at the moment I kind of want thoughts...
The idea is it just keeps track of info (Maybe spells), spellslots for you. It'd probably work quite similarly to the Cafe Menu though honestly.

You can input your class & level [Basically the right side of this table https://mykindofmeeple.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Wizard-spell-slots-table-5e-dnd-735x473.jpg.webp] 
it'll tell you the spell slots you have per level back.
[Feature 1]

Then you input spells known [this would be quite the database though so it'll likely be limited] so it can keep track of which spells you have prepared. 
You can add / remove the spells known as a second option. 
This would likely write into a new document for you. 
[Feature 2]

Have an external file for a database of (some) spells as a class being:
Spell name = [cost, spell-slot, description]. User can add to this database as well.
[Feature 3]



nice to have

Then choose to use a spell, it'll provide the cost, ask what level you want to use it at and then provide the description of the spell. 
Automatically use the associated spell slot off your characters sheet for you. 
If you're unable to use it, the app should then be able to tell you that you've used up all your resources and maybe suggest the next highest available spellslot.

Potential option for feature ?4? could be to recommend a spell to learn and reason why. 
Only reason I have this here is I can't think of an example of using a for loop for the rest but I haven't exactly thought through how I'm doing the others yet. 
If those don't use for loops, this would (to check against the spells known).
