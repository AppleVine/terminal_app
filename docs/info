Python app needs:
- Usage of variables
- Usage of loops
- Usage of conditional code (eg. if statements)
- Usage of Python pip packages
- Usage of your own created functions
- Usage of functions from pip packages
- To get user input and print stuff based on that input
- To stick to Python PEP8 (or some other specific) style guide
- To include two tests relevant to the app (eg. written in pytest)

Project overall also needs: 
- A readme that explains how to install needed packges and then run the app
- Proof of usage of Trello to keep track of what you need to work on
- To include a custom bash script (eg. something.sh) that runs your app
- A recording or link to a recording of you walking through your app and explaining it how it works
- Proof of git usage with at least 20 commits total (multiple commits per day!)
